## ABOUT THIS ARTICLE

Racket's official documents has do-loop syntax description [[link]](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/for.html#%28form._%28%28lib._racket%2Fprivate%2Fmore-scheme..rkt%29._do%29%29).  
But the description has no samples to aid our understanding. So I created some samples.

## ENVIRONMENT

Operation has been tested in Racket v8.5.
