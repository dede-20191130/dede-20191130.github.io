## ABOUT THIS ARTICLE

Windows10 has a video recording app named Game Bar, and we can record normal application by it.

But, I found forms of Excel and Access can't be captured since they aren't regarded as screen!

So, I've searched a solution, and I found it that recording function of PowerPoint is suitable for it. I'm going to describe it.



## HOW TO
### i. LAUNCH POWERPOINT
